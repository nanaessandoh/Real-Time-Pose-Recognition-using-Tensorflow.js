# Pose Detection using Posenet built in top of tensoflow.js core API

# Description
PoseNet can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video

The single person pose detector is implemented in our demo because it is faster and simpler but requires only one subject present in the image
